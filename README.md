# Image-caption-Generator
NLP
1. Model Selection:Vision Transformer (ViT): A state-of-the-art deep learning
model designed for image classification tasks.GPT-2 Language Model: A
transformer-based language model that generates coherent text.
2. Dataset Preparation:The Flickr8k dataset is used, which contains 8,000 images
and five different captions for each image. Each image is paired with a caption that
describes its contents. converting them to RGB and resizing them.
3. Image Preprocessing:Before feeding the images into the model, the images are
processed using the ViTImageProcessor. This step includes converting the image
into an appropriate format, resizing it to fit the input requirements of the Vision
Transformer, and extracting pixel values that can be fed into the model.
4. Caption Generation:The caption generation process involves:
Image Feature Extraction: The images are passed through the Vision Transformer

model to extract high-dimensional features. These features encode information
about the content and context of the image.Text Generation: The extracted features
are passed to the GPT-2 model, which decodes them into a meaningful text caption.
5. Inference and Testing:Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate
captions for new, unseen images. The image is passed through the same process
(preprocessing, feature extraction, and caption generation), and the output is a
textual description of the image.
6. Evaluation and Fine-tuning:The performance of the model is evaluated using
common metrics for image captioning, such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation
Understudy) scores, which measure how close the generated caption is to the
human-written captions.
7. Application and Deployment:The final system can be applied in real-world use
cases, such as:Automatically generating image captions for websites,Assisting
visually impaired individuals by providing text descriptions of images.
